<p>


Do we really want to see a 25 year old woman leave behind two children and die? Have learned nothing from Anna Nicole Smith?

I know it’s hard to see Britney Spears as a human being but trust me, she is. She’s a person. She’s like you or I.

And I don’t know about you, but i know that I would be pretty shaken up right now.

Whatever the cause of her performance was, I don’t care. All I care about is Britney’s wellbeing. And Britney all I want is for you to get well. That’s all I want

And what really bothers me is to think of those people out there who don’t see her as a person. And if anything ever happened to Britney Spears, the world can kiss my ass goodbye. 

Because if anything ever happens to her I’m jumping off the nearest fucking building. I don’t care what anyone says. I love Britney. And if anything ever happens to her, if she ever commits suicide because of a fucking idiot blogger, I will kill myself too. Get well Britney.

The world needs to know that Britney still has her fans. Britney needs to know that she still has her fans. I love you britney, just know that. Ok? Just know that.

How fucking dare anyone out there make fun of Britney after all she has been through.!

She lost her aunt, she went through a divorce. She had two fuckin kids.

Her husband turned out to be a user, a cheater, and now she's going through a custody battle. All you people care about is... readers and making money off of her.

SHE'S A HUMAN! What you don't realize is that Britney is making you all this money and all you do is write a bunch of crap about her.

She hasn't performed on stage in years. Her song is called "Give Me More" for a reason because all you people want is MORE! MORE-MORE, MORE: MORE!.

LEAVE HER ALONE! You are lucky she even performed for you BASTARDS! LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!...Please.

Perez Hilton talked about professionalism and said if Britney was a professional she would've pulled it off no matter what.

Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard time.

Leave Britney Alone Please!
Leave Britney Spears alone! Right now! I mean it!

Anyone that has a problem with her you deal with me, because she is not well right now.</p>
