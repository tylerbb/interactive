    The internet as the front page:

    Over break a friend texted me with a picture of an old New York Times they found in their grandparents’ attic: the front page announced “MEN WALK ON MOON.” I started tearing up. There’s a beauty in the finite that the internet has erased. information is too accessible (or, rather, information is hyper accessible, <em>dis</em>information is too accessible). Maybe the power of editors was too great before. Deciding what stories got told meant that many stories went ignored. But having certain national stories told in national sources gave helped bring people together. Is twitter’s top trending the new front page? in some ways it feels like it, but we don’t seem to be brought together in the same way when the story is #TaylorIsOverParty

    Do we then get the <h3>internet as chicken tender thursday everyday?</h3> what used to be a good thing, something to look forward to, loses it’s charm and excitement in excess. Has the internet gone too far? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but has it not gone too far? not yes.

    Maybe the internet is more of a 
      <div id="blackhole">
    blackhole
      </div>
     — i dont actually know much about blackholes but im thinking like, there’s a lot going on in there and it will consume you and destroy you unless you keep a safe distance. But also can blackholes flare up and consume things nearby anyways? that seems like a thing. Which would fit this metaphor cuz what happens online doesn’t stay online. Political movements, manifestos, etc all have ~real~ impacts.

    But then there’s a tension: the accessibility of the internet is part of what makes it so great, everyone has a voice. But it also means that dangerous voices have a voice. I guess twitter and others try to solve this by having the internet be a series of blue checkmarks, but that’s not really effective in it’s current form. And the internet can’t be like the medical profession, where hopefuls must be accredited before using it.

    So i guess for now it’s probably best to just keep considering the internet as the pinnacle of surveillance capitalism predicated on an ad duopoly where users’ increased access to information isn’t so much the end but rather the means…. idk if this last part counts as a metaphor still
